Hi everyone, 
This is my own personal space for documenting and saving every step of my Python self learning journey. 
Started very recently in April 2025, I have been self studying online and now are able to write some simple programmes on my own. 
I am very excited and looking forward to uploading even more Python projects in the future. 

Thanks for dropping by, would be happy to help in any ways!
